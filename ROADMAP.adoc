= ROADMAP: displace - Cross-Platform Verified File Copy Utility

:toc: left
:toclevels: 3

*This document outlines the development roadmap for `displace`, targeting a comprehensive, high-performance, and fully supply-chain-verified file copying solution up to version 12.*

== Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Version 0.1.0 (Current)

The current version of `displace` (v0.1.0) serves as the MVP, establishing the foundational capabilities:

*   **Core Functionality**: Fast, recursive file and directory copying.
*   **Basic CLI**: Command-line interface with source and destination arguments.
*   **Initial Containerization**: A `Containerfile` for basic image building (without full verification integration).
*   **Foundational Compliance**: Adherence to the AI Gatekeeper Protocol and initial repository structuring (e.g., `.machine_readable/`, `.bot_directives/`).
*   **Producer Blueprint**: A `build_verified_container.sh` script outlining the steps to integrate with the Verified Container Specification.

**Goal**: Provide a functional, albeit unverified, high-performance copy utility with a clear path towards full verification.

== Phase 1: Foundational Verification - Version 1.0.0

**Goal**: Achieve full compliance as a "Producer" within the Verified Container Specification.

*   **Verified Container Build Pipeline**: Fully automate the `build_verified_container.sh` script, replacing placeholders with actual tool integrations for:
    *   **SLSA Provenance Generation**: Integration of a tool (e.g., `Cerro Torre` or similar) to generate SLSA v1 provenance.
    *   **SPDX SBOM Generation**: Integration of a tool (e.g., Syft, Trivy) to generate SPDX 2.3 SBOMs.
    *   **JSON Canonicalization**: Ensure all generated JSON artifacts conform to the Verified Container Specification's JCS rules.
    *   **DSSE Wrapping & Signing**: Integration with a signing tool to wrap attestations in DSSEs and sign them using keys from the configured Trust Store.
    *   **Transparency Log Interaction**: Integration with clients for submitting attestations to (at least two) transparency logs and retrieving inclusion proofs.
    *   **OCI Referrers Publishing**: Automated pushing of the attestation bundle as an OCI Referrer.
*   **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Develop extensive unit and integration tests for the core copying logic and verification pipeline components.
*   **Cross-Compilation Testing**: Establish CI/CD for building and testing across target platforms (Linux x86_64, aarch64, RISC-V, BSD variants).

== Phase 2: Enhanced Copying & Integrity - Versions 2.0.0 - 3.0.0

**Goal**: Introduce advanced copying features and robust integrity checks.

*   **File Verification**: Implement optional checksum-based verification (SHA256, SHA512, BLAKE3) of copied files.
*   **Delta Copy/Sync**: Add functionality to intelligently copy only changed or new files, synchronizing source and destination.
*   **Exclusion/Inclusion Filters**: Support for `gitignore`-like patterns or regex for selective copying.
*   **Resume Capability**: Ability to resume interrupted copy operations.
*   **Performance Metrics**: Detailed reporting of transfer speeds, bandwidth utilization, and I/O statistics.

== Phase 3: Advanced Security & Observability - Versions 4.0.0 - 6.0.0

**Goal**: Deepen security features and provide better operational insight.

*   **Integrity Monitoring (Consumer)**: Develop a complementary `displace` mode that acts as a "Consumer" of Verified Containers, verifying images before operation (e.g., running `displace` within a verified container context).
*   **Encryption at Rest/Transit**: Optional encryption of data during transfer or at the destination.
*   **Resource Throttling**: Control over bandwidth and I/O usage during copying.
*   **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all copy operations and verification events.
*   **Policy Engine Integration**: Ability to integrate with external policy engines for fine-grained control over copy operations.

== Phase 4: Decentralized Trust & Ecosystem Integration - Versions 7.0.0 - 9.0.0

**Goal**: Leverage decentralized trust models and expand ecosystem integration.

*   **Federated Trust Store Management**: Tools and processes for securely updating and distributing Trust Stores.
*   **Distributed Attestation Services**: Explore integration with decentralized attestation services.
*   **Plug-in Architecture**: Allow for extension of `displace` with custom verification steps or data sources.
*   **ABI/FFI Compliance**: Full implementation of Hyperpolymath Universal ABI/FFI Standards for core components, leveraging Idris2 and Zig for formally verified interfaces.

== Phase 5: Formal Verification & Autonomous Operation - Versions 10.0.0 - 12.0.0

**Goal**: Achieve the highest levels of formal assurance and enable autonomous, verifiable operations.

*   **Formal Verification of Core Logic**: Apply formal methods (e.g., SPARK, Idris2 proofs) to critical sections of the `displace` codebase, particularly verification and integrity checks.
*   **Adaptive Verification Policies**: Implement AI-driven adaptive verification policies based on threat models and environmental context.
*   **Autonomous Agent Integration**: Enable `displace` to be an intelligent agent in an autonomous, self-healing system, performing verifiable data movements without human intervention.
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography Readiness**: Full transition to and formal verification of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (e.g., ML-DSA-87 only) as mandated by the Verified Container Specification.
